Exam Strategy:
When you practice exam with real questions you will get more confident. https://www.awslagi.com do the right ways to help you pass exam.
Practice with real questions is the best way to help you pass exam. 30$ totally worthed
At the time of writing the exam is 77-80 questions to be answered over 170 minutes.  Your best bet is to allow only 2mins per question with the remaining 10mins for checking over your answers and/or a small contingency.  The questions are 90% scenario based with often several paragraphs of writing to read.  More often than not several of the answers could be correct with one being “more” correct than the others.

Practice on staying focused.  Keeping attentive for 3 hours solid can be hard.  I used ear plugs (my exams were taken in London and there was a lot of outside noise going on), had a strong coffee beforehand and ensured I went to the bathroom immediately before the exam (I really struggle to hold for three hours so this was an essential for me!).  Bear in mind if you do a practice exam the real is double what you’ve just been through.  I remember being really bored after about 50 questions so really had to focus for the last 30!  I also always book my exams for mid-morning, when I feel most alert and not in the afternoon, if I can help it, as I concentrate less towards the end of the day.

Spot check your time periodically.  I did this every 10 questions to ensure I was running to time.  Don’t do it after every question because quite often, if you do lose time, you can pull it back at a later point.  So simply go into the exam knowing that after 10 questions you should still have 2hours 30mins left, after 20 questions 2hours 10mins etc.
